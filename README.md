# Smart Expense Tracker  
Smart Expense Tracker is a secure full-stack web application built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**. It allows users to register, log in securely, and manage daily income and expenses with real-time analytics and dashboards.

This project demonstrates complete frontend–backend integration, RESTful API development, authentication, database modeling, and secure user-specific data handling.

---

##  Module-Based Implementation

The project was developed in structured modules, each focusing on a specific full-stack concept.

---

## 1. Project Planning & Architecture

- Designed high-level system architecture  
- Defined frontend–backend communication flow  
- Structured folder organization  
- Planned API endpoints and database schema  

**Outcome:** Clear roadmap before implementation.

---

## 2. Frontend Development (React)

- Built Login & Registration pages  
- Created Dashboard layout  
- Developed reusable components  
- Implemented responsive UI  

**Outcome:** Functional and user-friendly interface.

---

## 3. Backend Development (Node.js + Express)

- Set up Express server  
- Created RESTful API routes  
- Structured controllers and middleware  
- Implemented CRUD operations for income & expenses  

**Outcome:** Fully functional backend API layer.

---

## 4. Database Integration (MongoDB + Mongoose)

- Connected backend to MongoDB  
- Created User, Income, and Expense schemas  
- Implemented data validation  
- Ensured user-specific data storage  

**Outcome:** Persistent and structured data management.

---

## 5. Authentication & Security

- Password hashing using **bcrypt**  
- JWT-based authentication  
- Protected routes using middleware  
- Secure token verification  

**Outcome:** Secure login and authorization system.

---

## 6. API Integration (Frontend ↔ Backend)

- Used Axios for API calls  
- Sent JWT token with requests  
- Managed state updates after API responses  
- Handled errors and loading states  

**Outcome:** Seamless frontend–backend communication.

---

## 7. Dashboard & Analytics

- Displayed total balance summary  
- Implemented income vs expense tracking  
- Integrated interactive charts  
- Displayed recent transactions  

**Outcome:** Visual representation of financial data.

---

## 8. Testing & Deployment Preparation

- Tested APIs using Postman  
- Configured environment variables  
- Cleaned and optimized code  
- Prepared production-ready structure  

**Outcome:** Complete, secure, and deployment-ready application.
