# Smart-Expense-Tracker
Smart Expense Tracker is a secure full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The application allows users to register, log in securely, and manage their daily income and expenses with real-time analytics and visual dashboards.

This project demonstrates complete frontend–backend integration, RESTful API development, database modeling, authentication, and secure user-specific data handling.

📚 Module-Based Implementation

The project was developed in structured modules, each focusing on a specific full-stack concept.

🟢 Module 1: Project Planning & Architecture

Designed high-level system architecture

Defined frontend–backend communication flow

Structured folder organization

Planned API endpoints and database schema

Outcome: Clear roadmap before implementation.

🟢 Module 2: Frontend Development (React)

Built Login & Registration pages

Created Dashboard layout

Developed reusable components

Implemented responsive UI

Outcome: Functional and user-friendly interface.

🟢 Module 3: Backend Development (Node.js + Express)

Set up Express server

Created RESTful API routes

Structured controllers and middleware

Implemented CRUD operations for income & expenses

Outcome: Fully functional backend API layer.

🟢 Module 4: Database Integration (MongoDB + Mongoose)

Connected backend to MongoDB

Created User, Income, and Expense schemas

Implemented data validation

Ensured user-specific data storage

Outcome: Persistent and structured data management.

🟢 Module 5: Authentication & Security

Password hashing using bcrypt

JWT-based authentication

Protected routes using middleware

Secure token verification

Outcome: Secure login and authorization system.

🟢 Module 6: API Integration (Frontend ↔ Backend)

Used Axios for API calls

Sent JWT token with requests

Managed state updates after API responses

Handled errors and loading states

Outcome: Seamless frontend–backend communication.

🟢 Module 7: Dashboard & Analytics

Displayed total balance summary

Implemented income vs expense tracking

Integrated interactive charts

Displayed recent transactions
