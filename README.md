# Smart-Expense-Tracker
Smart Expense Tracker is a secure full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to register, log in securely, and manage daily income and expenses with real-time analytics and dashboards.

This project demonstrates complete frontend–backend integration, RESTful API development, authentication, database modeling, and secure user-specific data handling.

📚 Module-Based Implementation

The project was developed in structured modules, each focusing on a specific full-stack concept.
